## About Django Admin FlexSelect ##

FlexSelect is a small app for the Django Admin that makes it trivial to have
foreign keys depend on each other. By depend I mean that choices and additional 
content of one field updates dynamically when another is changed.

## Usage example ##

See the video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooii3iCTZ6o.

In the following we will define a Case model with two foreign key fields, a 
base field `client` and a trigger field `company_contact_person`. When we 
change the client on the Case change view the company_contact_person updates 
accordingly. Furthermore we will display the customer_contact_persons company 
and email as additional details. 

In "models.py":

```python
from django.db import models as m
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

"""
No changes to the models are needed to use flexselect.
"""

class Company(m.Model):
    name = m.CharField(max_length=80)
    
    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.name

class CompanyContactPerson(m.Model):
    company = m.ForeignKey(Company)
    name = m.CharField(max_length=80)
    email = m.EmailField()
    
    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.name
    
class Client(m.Model):
    company = m.ForeignKey(Company)
    name = m.CharField(max_length=80)
    
    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.name
     
class Case(m.Model):
    client = m.ForeignKey(Client)
    company_contact_person = m.ForeignKey(CompanyContactPerson)
    
    def clean(self):
        """
        Makes sure the company for client is the same as the company for the 
        customer contact person. Note that you need to check for `None` too
        if the fields are not required.
        """
        if not self.client.company == self.company_contact_person.company:
            raise ValidationError('The clients and the contacts company does'
                                  ' not match.')
    
    def __unicode__(self):
        return u'Case: %d' % self.id
```

## Installation ##

    sudo pip install django-admin-flexselect
    
## Configuration ##

1. Add `"flexselect",` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in "settings.py".

2. Add `(r'^flexselect/', include('flexselect.urls')),` to "urls.py".

### Options ###
As of yet, flexselect only have one configuration option, namely 
"include_jquery" that if set to true will include jQuery and jQueryUI from 
the google ajax CDN. It defaults to false and the entire FLEXSELECT dict can
be omitted.

```python
# Flexselect settings.
FLEXSELECT = {
    'include_jquery': True,
}
```

### Static files ###
FlexSelect requires "django.contrib.staticfiles" installed to work 
out of the box. If it is not then include "jQuery", "jQueryUI" and 
"flexselect/static/flexselect/js/flexselect.js" manually. Read more about 
"django.contrib.staticfiles" at 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/contrib/staticfiles/.
